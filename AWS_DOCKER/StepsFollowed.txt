Steps followed:

1) Create a python flask file (index.py)
2) Write your flask code:

index.py

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int("8080"), debug=True)


3) Create a Dockerfile (Exposing the 5000 port) (attached)
4) Create a requirements.txt file and write flask dependency
5) Now ssh into you AWS EC2 instance and run the following commands:
	a) docker build --tag file10 .
	b) docker run --name file11 -p 5000:8080 file10

6) Go to your EC2 instance's security group and allow the http port with respect to your IP.
7) Since the docker is running in the cloud EC2 instance, to check the flask URL status, use the following command
	- wget http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (This will give you the status of the website)
	- curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (This will give you the contents of the flask app)
Note:
If you port is already in use, Use the following command:
sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
And then rebuild your docker image
